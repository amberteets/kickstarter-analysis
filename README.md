# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise is interested in using Kickstarter to fund plays. This analysis was conducted to look at trends in Kickstarter data and ultimately determine factors that influence the likelihood of a campaign succeeding, so that Louise is best prepared to launch a successful campaign. Specifically, campaign **launch date** and **funding goal** are analyzed individually to determine the best time of year and the ideal funding goal to launch a successful theater/play campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To analyze outcomes based on launch date, a pivot table and pivot chart were created using the full Kickstarter dataset. The pivot table was organized and filtered (see images below) to show the relevant data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
